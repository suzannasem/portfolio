Welcome and thank you for visiting! On this site, you'll find projects I've worked on for courses, internships, academic research, or just for fun. 

A little about me: I'm an A.B./M.A. student at Bryn Mawr college majoring in mathematics and minoring in data science. My research interests have grown with me: I started my academic career in theoretical physics, wrote my master's thesis on biological modeling, and am pursuing a career in finance post-graduation. At the heart of my experience is a passion for understanding complex systems.  

You can browse my projects by `tags` to explore different topics and computational methods. Over the years I've used
* Game Theory
* Partial/Ordinary Differential Equations
* Bayesian and NHST Inference
* Neural Networks
* Optimal Control & Numerical Optimization

to answer questions in
* Epidemiology
* Systems Biology
* Population Ecology
* Finance

and more!
