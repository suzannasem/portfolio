I'm currently working with Dr. Erica J. Graham of Bryn Mawr College to understand the impact of hormonal fluctuations on lesion growth in endometriosis. This model is the first incorporating hormonal and receptor-binding dynamics in disease onset.

## Motivation

Endometriosis is a gynecological condition that presents with symptoms ranging from severe pelvic pain to infertility. It is characterized by growth of endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity; these lesions, though typically appearing near the pelvis, may appear anywhere from the peritoneum (a membrane protecting the abdominal organs), to the ovaries, and even in the abdominal/chest area. Diagnosis typically takes around $4-12$ years due to the invasive nature of diagnostic surgery and widespread medical bias against female patients. Diagnosis is typically visually confirmed by presence of lesions after laparoscopic surgery, though imaging techniques such as ultrasound can also be used, while treatment is symptoms-based and typically involves progestin medication, NSAIDs, or hysterectomy. Endometriosis is grossly understudied, evident from the limited diagnostic and treatment options
